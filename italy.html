    <h1>Italy</h1>
    
    <p>Italy became a nation-state in <time datetime="1861">1861</time> when the regional states of the peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, 
    were united under King Victor Emmanuel II. An era of parliamentary government came to a close in the early 1920s 
    when Benito Mussolini established a Fascist dictatorship. 
    
    <p>His alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's defeat in World War II. A democratic republic replaced the monarchy in 1946 and economic revival followed.</p>
    
    <p>Italy is a charter member of <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization">NATO</abbr> and the European Economic Community ( <abbr title="European Economic Community">EEC</abbr> ) and its subsequent successors the <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> and the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. It has been
    at the forefront of European economic and political unification, joining the Economic and Monetary Union in <time datetime="1999">1999</time>.</p>
    
    <p>Persistent problems include sluggish economic growth, high youth and female unemployment, organized crime, corruption,
    and economic disparities between southern Italy and the more prosperous north.</p>
